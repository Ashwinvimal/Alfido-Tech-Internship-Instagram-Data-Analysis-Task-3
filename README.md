# Alfido-Tech-Internship-Instagram-Data-Analysis-Task-3
This project analyzes the Instagram dataset using Python. It involves data cleaning, visualization, and insights to understand user behavior, popular photos, most used tags, like/comment patterns, and location-based trends. Visuals highlight engagement metrics and help uncover key patterns in social media activity.

üìä Instagram Data Analysis Project

üìù Description

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Instagram's social media dataset using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. It aims to uncover insights related to user behavior, post engagement, tag usage, and location-based trends. Through various charts and plots, this analysis helps identify:

1.Top users by photo uploads

2.Most liked and commented photos

3.Most frequently used tags

4.Locations with the highest tag usage

5.Overall engagement patterns and content preferences

By visualizing this data, we gain a deeper understanding of what drives popularity and interaction on social media platforms like Instagram.
